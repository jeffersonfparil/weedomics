# Past, present, and future patterns of herbicide resistance across Southeast Australia

This a public repository detailing the population and quantitative genetics analyses of *Lolium rigidum* populations from Southeast (SE) Australia sampled between 2017 and 2022. The dataset includes phenotype data in the form of resistances to 12 herbicides (clethodim, imazamox with imazapyr, sulfometuron, terbuthylazine, atrazine, tri-allate, prosulfocarb with S-metolachlor, pyroxasulfone, paraquat, glyphosate, bixlozone, and cinmethylin), and genotype data in the form of pool sequencing after double restriction enzyme digestion (Pool-ddRADseq using MseI and NsiI, seleting 150-400 base-pairs fragments).

## Main aim and hypotheses

This study aims to characterise the current, past and future patterns of herbicide resistance across SE Australia, i.e. infer the most likely evolutionary path leading to this pattern, and predict future resistance development/spread using genomic, environmental (climatic and edaphic information), and herbicide resistance data.
